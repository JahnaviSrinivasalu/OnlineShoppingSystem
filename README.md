Online Shopping Application is a console-based Java project that provides a simple simulation of an e-commerce system. It includes separate modules for administrators and customers, enabling admins to manage products and orders, while customers can register, view available products, and place orders. Built using object-oriented principles, the application features a modular structure with entity, service, and application layers, demonstrating practical implementation of classes, inheritance, and interaction between components through a command-line interface.
